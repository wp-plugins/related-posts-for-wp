Related Posts for WordPress offers you the ability to link related posts to each other with just 1 click!

Our installation wizard will do all the hard work for you, simply activate the plugin, set the amount of posts that should relate and press the button. Related Posts for WordPress will do the rest. Relating posts in WordPress has never been this easy!

= Related Posts for WordPress won't lag your server! =
We don't think having related posts should slow down your website. That's why Related Posts for WordPress creates its own cache and does all the heavy lifting in the admin panel, keeping your website fast as it should be!

= Automatically link posts to each other =
After installing the plugin you will be taking to a wizard that will analyze your posts and link them to each other based on what we think is related. This means you can install Related Posts for WordPress on your website that has thousands of posts and create related connections on the fly, without any manual work!

= Manually add, edit or remove =
Everyone makes mistakes, so do we. That's why you can easily modify all automatically created related posts. Simply navigate to the post that has incorrect related posts attached to it, edit it and you're done.

= WPML compatible =
Related Posts for WordPress is fully compatible with WPML. You can automatically and manually link related posts in their own language.
